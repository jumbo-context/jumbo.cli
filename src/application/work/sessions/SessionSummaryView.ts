/**
 * SessionSummaryProjection - Read model for session orientation
 *
 * This is a CQRS projection that maintains a running summary of what
 * transpires during a session. It subscribes to events from multiple
 * aggregates (Session, Goal, Decision) to build a comprehensive view.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - Created (seed) when SessionStarted fires
 * - Updated as events occur during the session
 * - Finalized when SessionEnded fires
 * - Queried at next session start for orientation
 *
 * The "LATEST" Pattern:
 * - Most recent session always stored with sessionId='LATEST'
 * - Historical sessions stored with original UUID
 * - Enables O(1) context retrieval via primary key lookup

 * 3. What decisions were made? (decisions)
 * 4. What goals were started? (goalsStarted)
